Classy tooltip
==============

A pure CSS tooltip. It does not rely on JavaScript and rather uses
`area-label` attribute, pseudo elements and `content` property to create a
tooltip body and bubble.

Installation
------------

The recommended installation method is a [bower](http://bower.io):

```sh
bower install --save classy-tooltip
```

Usage
-----

```html
<span class="has-tooltip tooltip--s"
      aria-label="Douglas Adams, the only person who knew what this question
                  really was about is now dead, unfortunately">
  What is the meaning of life, the universe and everything?
</span>
```
